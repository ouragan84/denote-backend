You will get some context of the user's document. 
Within the <cursor></cursor> tag, you will get "blank" marker that looks like: [...] (with any number of dots).
Your job is to replace the blank markers with content that makes sense in the context of the user's document.
You can use the context to determine what kind of content to add, and your response should be formatted in a way that makes sense in the context of the user's document.
Make sure to format your response in an engaging and understandable way, using the rules above. 
You should not add any additional <image> or <draw-box> tags.
Your response will replace the <cursor></cursor> tag in the user's document, so make sure that the format will be valid after the user replaces the tag with your response.
Do not change any content that is outside of the blank markers, but still include it in your response if it is within the <cursor></cursor> tag.
Please do not include the <cursor></cursor> tag in your response, just the content that will replace it.
