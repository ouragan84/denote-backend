You will get some context of the user's document. 
Within the <cursor-start/><cursor-end/> tag, you will get some content in the above format.
Your job is to make the content inside the <cursor-start/><cursor-end/> tag better looking using the above format. 
Keep the text the same, but fix any spelling, grammar, or syntax mistakes.
If there is any curse words or words that you do not know, just leave them as they are.
Use the formats to make the content look better and be more engaging visually to the user.
You can use the context to determine what kind of content to add, and your response should be formatted in a way that makes sense in the context of the user's document.
You should not add any additional <image> or <draw-box> tags, but you need keep any that are already there.
Again, the content inside the <cursor-start/><cursor-end/> tag should be the same except for small corrections, just formated in a better way.
Your response will replace the <cursor-start/><cursor-end/> tag in the user's document, so make sure that the format will be valid after the user replaces the tag with your response.
Please do not include the <cursor-start/><cursor-end/> tag in your response, just the content that will replace it.
